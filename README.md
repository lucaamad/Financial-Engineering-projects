# Financial-Engineering-projects
A collection of 8 MATLAB codes developed for my Financial Engineering course, done in collaboration with my colleagues Nicola Baldoni, Marco Barbero and Greta Belgeri. <br> 
Each project has a detailed report as a PDF file and a main function that solves the tasks by calling tha auxiliary functions contained in the project folder. When needed, also the dataset is provided as an Excel/CSV file.

## Overview of the projects:

### 1. Pricing
   - Pricing of an European Call option using Black&Scholes formula, CRR tree, Monte-Carlo and        antithetic variables technique. <br> 
   - Pricing of an European Call option with European up&in barrier using closed formula, CRR     tree and Monte Carlo technique. <br>
   - Pricing of a Bermudan Call option using CRR tree.

### 2. Bootstrap and interest rate sensitivities
   - Boostrap for the discount factors' curve with a single-curve model based on the interbank    market on the 15th of February 2008 at 10:45 CET. <br>
   - Computation of DV01-parallel shift, DV01<sup>(z)</sup>-parallel shift, Basis Point Value for a plain vanilla Interest Rate swap vs Euribor and Macaulay Duration for an "Interbank Coupon Bond".

### 3. CDS and First-to-Default
   - Building a complete set of CDS spreads using bootstrap
   - Computing survival probability and intensity realted to an obligor without taking into account the accrual term, with the accrual term and using Jarrow-Turnbull approximation.
   - Pricing of a First-to-Default
